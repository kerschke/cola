# @title Calculate GCM features for a given function
# 
# @description
# Based on Generalized Cell Mapping (GCM) techniques, the cell mappings are interpreted as
# an absorbing Markov chain, from which 24 features are derived.
# 
# Provided the decision space is divided into a grid of cells, GCM incorporates
# the dynamics of a system into the cell mapping. For each cell, the probabilities of transitioning
# to successor cells are calculated, where each cell can have multiple successor cells. 
#  
# Computation is performed based on \code{min}, \code{mean}, and \code{near} approaches for finding a representative
# objective function value for each cell.
# 
# @param feat.object [\code{\link{FeatureObject}}]\cr
#   A feature object as created by \code{\link{createFeatureObject}}.
#   Note that the object needs to contain the number of blocks per dimension
#   (parameter \code{blocks}) in order to allow cellmapping features to compute.
# @param control [\code{\link{list}}]\cr
#   A list object that stores additional configuration parameters.
#   The following parameters are used here:\cr
#   \code{gcm.plot} is a boolean, indicating whether GCM results are visualised in a plot.\cr
#   \code{gcm.plot.colors} is a vector defining the first cell colours to be used by the plot.
#      Note that the first colour is used for cells that belong to multiple attractors,
#      the second colour is used for attractors, 
#      and the remaining ones are assigned to cells with distinct single attractors.
# @return [\code{\link{list}(24)} of \code{\link{numeric}(1)}].\cr
#   List of features.\cr
#   For further information, see details.
# @details
#   For the \code{min}, \code{mean}, and \code{near} approaches, \code{calculateGCMFeatures} 
#   calculates seven features each. Furthermore, three features summarise the 
#   findings of the \code{min} and \code{mean} approaches in order to study similarities and 
#   differences between both.\cr
#   \code{gcm.{min, mean, near}$uncert_ratio}: Ratio of uncertain cells (for min and mean approaches),\cr
#   \code{gcm.{min, mean, near}$prob_best}: Probability to find the best cell,\cr
#   \code{gcm.{min, mean, near}${min, max, mean, std}_bs}: Aggregations of the different basin sizes,\cr
#   \code{gcm.{min, mean, near}$no_attr}: Number of attractors within the grid,\cr
#   \code{gcm.common.pcells}: Number of periodic cells common between min and mean approaches,\cr
#   \code{gcm.common.tcells}: Number of transient cells common between min and mean approaches, and\cr
#   \code{gcm.common.dcells}: Percentage of cells that change their roles from one approach to the other.
