# returns possible coordinates of neighbours of a cell, one coordinate per row.
## A cell is considered a neighbour of itself, but this is eliminated in next step
## (see "isNeighbourInvalid" below), together with neighbours outside the bounds.

## coordinate: vector, defining the cell by its block-dimensions
## nsize: ???
## cellSize: vector of d elements - indicating the cell size per dimension

# i.e. return TRUE for those neighbours that are outside the bounds of divisions or
#     that are the cell itself
## currentCoord: Coordinate of the current cell
## neighbourCoord: Coordinate of the neighbour
## divisions: Given GCM divisions
