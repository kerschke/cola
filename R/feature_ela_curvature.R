# @title Calculate Curvature Features
# @description
# Computes features, which quantify the curvature of a function.
# @param feat.object [\code{\link{FeatureObject}}]\cr
# A feature object as created by \link{createFeatureObject}.\cr
# Note, that the feature object has to contain the function itself in
# order to compute the convexity features.
# @param control [\code{\link{list}}]\cr
# A list object that stores additional configuration parameters:\cr
# The element \code{curv.sample_size} defines the number of samples that are
# used for calculating the features. The default is \code{1000}.
# @details
# Given a feature object, \code{curv.sample_size} (per default
# \code{100 * d} with \code{d} being the number of features) samples are
# randomly chosen. Then, the gradient and hessian of the function are 
# estimated based on those points and the following features are computed:\cr
# 
# The first seven features (\code{curv.grad_norm}) aggregate the length of
# the gradients, the next seven features (\code{curv.grad_scale}) summarize
# the ratio of biggest and smallest (absolute) gradient direction and the
# remaining seven features (\code{curv.hessian_cond}) summarize the ratio of
# biggest and smallest eigenvalue of the hessian matrices. The aggregation
# is always done in the same order:\cr
# (1) minimum\cr
# (2) lower quartile (also known as 1st quartile or \code{25\%}-quantile)\cr
# (3) arithmetic mean\cr
# (4) median\cr
# (5) upper quartile (also known as 3rd quartile or \code{75\%}-quantile)\cr
# (6) maximum\cr
# (7) standard deviation\cr
#   
# The final two features show the amount of (additional) function
# evaluations and running time (in seconds) that were needed for the
# computation of these features.
# @return [\code{\link{list}(23)} of \code{\link{numeric}(1)}].\cr
# List of features.\cr

# @examples
# # (1) create a feature object:
# X = t(replicate(n = 2000, expr = runif(n = 5, min = -10, max = 10)))
# feat.object = createFeatureObject(X = X, fun = function(x) sum(x^2))
# 
# # (2) compute the curvature features:
# calculateCurvatureFeatures(feat.object)
# @export
