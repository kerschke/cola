# @title Calculate Linear Model Coefficient Features
# 
# @description
# Linear models are computed per cell, provided the decision space is divided
# into a grid of cells. Each one of the models has the form
# \code{objective ~ features}.
# @param feat.object [\code{\link{FeatureObject}}]\cr
# A feature object as created by \link{createFeatureObject}.
# @return [\code{\link{list}(14)} of \code{\link{numeric}(1)}].\cr
# List of features.\cr
# For further information, see details.
# @details
# The length of the average coefficient vector, i.e. the vector consisting of
# the average of the coefficients (per feature and over all cells), is
# computed based on the\cr
# (1) regular coefficient vectors.\cr
# (2) normalized coefficient vectors.\cr
# 
# For each cell, the length of the coefficient vector is computed and
# afterwards aggregated using the\cr
# (3) arithmetic mean.\cr
# (4) standard deviation.\cr
# 
# The correlation of all coefficient vectors is computed (w.r.t. the
# features) and aggregated using the arithmetic mean based on the\cr
# (5) regular coefficient vectors.\cr
# (6) normalized coefficient vectors.\cr
# 
# The ratios of (absolute) maximum and minimum coefficients are computed (per
# cell) and afterwards aggregated by the\cr
# (7) arithmetic mean.\cr
# (8) standard deviation.\cr
# 
# The standard deviation is computed (per feature) over all cells. Then, the
# ratio of biggest and smallest standard deviation is computed based on the\cr
# (9) regular coefficient vectors.\cr
# (10) normalized coefficient vectors.\cr
# 
# The same standard deviations, which have been used in the previous two
# features, are aggregated by the\cr
# (11) arithmetic mean.\cr
# (12) standard deviation.
# 
# The final two features show the amount of (additional) function
# evaluations and running time (in seconds) that were needed for the
# computation of these features.
# @examples
# # (1) create a feature object:
# X = t(replicate(1000, runif(n = 3)))
# feat.object = createFeatureObject(X = X, 
#   fun = function(x) sum(x^2), blocks = c(5, 10, 4))
#   
# # (2) compute the linear modell coefficient features:
# calculateLinearModelFeatures(feat.object = feat.object)
# @export
